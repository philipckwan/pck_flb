FIXED-get price from uniswap v3 has error
DONE-loop the swap fetching to identify opportunity to flashloan
DONE-enable the multi-logs and .env configurations
DONE-identify opportunity
DONE(20/5)-after identify opportunity, call flashloan
DONE-make the time interval to be configurable
DONE(18/5)-get gas price when pflb isOpp:true
-add a new log to track if flashloan is executed
-add grouping line to stats.log so that easier to tell within the same check
DONE(21/5,v0.14)-simplify the log pattern to reduce information such as year, logger name, etc...
DONE(20/5)-add a config parameter for flashloan threshold, i.e. if amount is > $10, then execute flashloan
DONE(20/5)-time the polyscan get gasPrice API call
DONE(20/5 v0.13)-consider to add ethers get gasPrice and compare the time with polyscan API
DONE(20/5 v0.13)-or, detach the API get gasPrice call to be run in parallel and save to a cache
DONE(21/5,v0.14)-HIGH-multiple concurrent flashloan execution issue, need to add a lock to prevent that
DONE(22/5,v1.0)-make GET_GAS_PRICE_FIELD and IS_USE_RECENT_GAS_PRICE configurable
DONE(23/5,v1.1)-add timing for isOpp check
DONE(24/5,v1.2)-catch error when get gas price failed
DONE(24/5,v1.3)-concurrent flashloan execution issue seems not fixed, need to revisit
DONE(25/5,v1.5)-add to current log the route (swap name) when isOpp:true
DONE(25/5,v1.5)-see if can de-couple the first and second route API call to improve performance
DONE(27/5,v1.6)-unexpected error: 05/26T13:16:41:562;ERROR;FlEx.executeFlashloan: ERROR - currently only support swapRoutes.idxBestRouterToAmountList.length == 2;
PARTIAL_DONE(30/5,v1.7)-still need to try de-couple the fromSwap with toSwap to improve performance
DONE(27/5,v1.6)-add isOpp:true indicator to log for PTSS
-oldStrategy: 05/26T08:21:53:090;ERROR;Error: insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost
-progressive increase gas price to see if can pre-empt the previous execution
DONE(v1.9)-reduce logging in PTSS and output the winning router 
DONE(v1.9)-log the time start and duration in PTSS when isOpp:true
DONE(31/5,v1.8)-lower the gasLimit (or make it configurable) so that the node can accept the tx earlier (i.e. the tx won't be using too much space of a block)
DONE(v1.9)-finish PTSS v2
DONE(v1.10)-reduce logging in PTSS v2, also log for the pair when displaying isOpp
DONE(v1.11)-remove eth get gasPrice as I am not using it, rearrange the logging code in GasPriceCalculator
DONE(v1.12)-increase the number of decimal point when logging prices to stats log file
